<div class="runningjourney"> 
    <p>There was a time when you dreaded the thought of running. Back in high school gym class, 
    every semester started with the infamous mile run. The coach would bark, "Four laps around the track!" 
    as if it were the easiest thing in the world. But to you, those four laps felt like an eternity.</p>
    
    <p>It wasn't just the physical struggle—it was the feeling of being on display. As someone who
     thrived in activities like pickleball, where you could strategically outwit your opponents or 
     have fun with a doubles partner, running felt monotonous and lonely. Worse, you couldn't hide 
     from the stopwatch. Each lap was timed, and you'd hear your coach announce your splits, louder 
     than necessary. "Two minutes, forty seconds!" he'd yell, as you wheezed by, feeling like you 
     were dragging cinder blocks.</p>
    
    <p>The worst part? Your friends didn't mind the run—they even seemed to enjoy it. You’d see them 
    effortlessly chatting as they loped along, while you were just trying to survive. By the third
     lap, your legs felt like jelly, and you’d inevitably start walking. "Come on! Push through!" 
     your coach would shout, but it felt like he just didn’t understand.

    Does this story sound familiar, because it does to me. I used to despise running, but I have learned to love it
    and here's how you can love it too:

<p>My personal running goals are to beat Shearer's Premiere League goal stats. Just kidding, I just need to insert a graph here, but what are your goals?</p>
